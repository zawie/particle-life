# Particle Life

Particle life is a particle simulator implementing non-standard physics.

Each particle color is randomly assigned different repelling or attracting forces to other particles. Conservation of energy is not required and forces do not need to be equal (Newton is rolling in his grave!)

This simple system displays emergent behavior as life like structures form under these simple constraints.
